# Data Structures & Algorithms Visualizer

**An interactive learning platform for data structures and algorithms.**  
Features live code execution, animated visualizations, running time graphs, and MDX-powered explanations.

---

## Features

- üìö **MDX-based content** for explanations and problems
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Live code editor and executor** (TypeScript, with multi-language support planned)
- üß© **Animated visualizers** for array operations (insert, delete, search, access)
- üìà **Performance graphs** using real measured times (`performance.now()`)
- üè∑Ô∏è **Running time tables** and theoretical vs. empirical comparison
- üåó **Dark/light theme** with Tailwind and theme switcher
- üñ±Ô∏è **Drag-to-scroll** for large visualizations
- ‚ôø **Accessible** and keyboard-friendly UI

## MDX Content

- Write your explanations and problems in `.mdx` files in `app/content/`.
- You can import data, components, and utilities directly into MDX.
- Example:

  ```mdx
  import { RunningTimeTable } from "@/components/RunningTimeTable";
  import { arrayRunningTimes } from "@/content/data/arrayRunningTimes";

  <RunningTimeTable times={arrayRunningTimes} />
  ```

---

## Visualizers

- **ArrayVisualizer**: Animates array operations and plots real running time as input size changes.
- **InteractiveRunningTimeGraph**: Lets you select which operation's performance graph to view.

---

## Performance Graphs

- Uses `performance.now()` to measure and plot actual operation times.
- Note: These are for visualization only and may vary by device/browser.

---

## Theming

- Uses Tailwind CSS with `darkMode: "class"`.
- Theme switcher is available; all components use `dark:` classes for styling.

---

## Accessibility

- All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
- Drag-to-scroll areas use appropriate ARIA roles and labels.

---

## Development Notes

- **Import order** is enforced via `eslint-plugin-import`.
- **TypeScript** is used throughout.
- **Recharts** is used for plotting graphs.
- **MDX** supports imports of data and components.
- **Performance data** is kept for each operation and input size, and is not reset when switching operations.
